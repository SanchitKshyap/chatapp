# Instant Messaging App

Users can send/receieve messages, images and emoji's to friends.

Users become friends by sending a friend request, These requests can only be sent to users that have their 'visibility' enabled (disabled by default) - This can be changed in account settings.

Users will receieve notifications for friend requests, friend request acceptance, and errors.

Active status, when users are 'active' i.e. one the site their friends will see they are active via a green icon on their avatar. (Could also add this to be configurable).

Night mode because every app/website should have one.
